I\u2019m Jongwoo Park and I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in Spring 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science. Influenced by my father who is a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I was exposed to computers and the internet at a very young age. Though I was not particularly interested in programming, I had many experiences toying with game developing tools and modding the video games I played. In fact, I enjoyed changing the finished product into something different and making it even better than before. Remembering this, I chose my major as computer science, an area of study where I can incorporate my creativity from music and manipulate products to make them better and more efficient. Currently, I have many different experiences in frontend development, with tools such as ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Flutter, and React Native. I enjoy exploring how aspects in UI/UX design intersects with front-end development.
